# ---------------- Day 14 Notes: Higher or Lower Game ----------------

# 1. What was covered in Day 14?
#    - Importing data from another file (game data)
#    - Using dictionaries to store and access information
#    - Implementing a comparison-based game logic
#    - Handling user input validation
#    - Keeping track of scores and looping until the user loses

# 2. Key Concepts:
#    - Functions: Encapsulating code into reusable blocks
#    - Dictionaries: Accessing values using keys
#    - Lists: Storing multiple data points
#    - Random module: Picking random values from a dataset
#    - Loops: Running the game continuously until the player makes a mistake

# 3. Summary of the Game Logic:
#    - Pick two random celebrities from the dataset
#    - Ask the user to guess who has a higher follower count
#    - If the user guesses correctly, they score a point, and the next round starts
#    - If they guess incorrectly, the game ends
#    - The goal is to score as many points as possible before making a wrong guess
